# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I'm going to use Social Icons, I'm pointing here to do not forget about this...
I need to import like 
import { SocialIcon } from 'react-social-icons';
Then I need to use the <SocialIcon url='https://twitter.com/test'/>
This is a self closed component that render the rigth icon for the passed URL...

I'm also going to use react-simple-typewriter to make a good typografy
